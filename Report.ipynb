    "New York City is one of the most multicultural cities in the world. There are many dining options in various locations in New York City such as Queens, New York. However, many dining options have fewer options for vegetarian and vegan restaurants though these options have become increasingly popular in the recent decade due to health-conscious consumers. It is known today that Vegetarians may have lower blood pressure, type -2 diabetes, lower cancer risk, and reduces risk for other chronic disease (Kelly, WebMD.com). Vegetarian and vegan food businesses are growing as studies are showing vegetarian diets may reduce healthcare costs and support the economy and environment (Davis, The Atlantic, 2016). Businesses looking to expand quality healthy foods not featuring animal products have much opportunity to establish themselves across Queens. According to Yelp.com reviews, quality vegetarian and vegan restaurants and dining venues would apparently be appreciated by local residents. More options will increase convenience for residents in particular neighborhoods by reducing travel and wait times for orders. A business with more options would satisfy specific vegetarian preferences of restaurant goers. For example, those who prefer to have or not to have certain vegetable, herbs, or spices in their foods would have more options. Those looking for a variety of unique and bold flavors in vegetarian and vegan options may be pleased with a new dining option. Businesses that enter into the Queens community may be more successful if carry-out, delivery, and dine-in are also available to residents. There are neighborhoods that businesses may do well in where there are beaches, site seeing areas, recreational areas, and farms or farmers markets to fit consumers' interests as high traffic areas that may successful characteristics for new business. First, it is helpful to look at where the few vegetarian and vegan options are located in Queens to either construct a new restaurant in these same areas that have interest in more options or to begin options in other Queens' neighborhoods that would appreciate the new business.\n",

    "Foursquare data was generated to explore the most popular venues to locate vegetarian and vegan restaurants to determine the best neighborhoods for additional sites of vegetarian and vegan restaurants. First, numpy, folium, pandas, json, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries are imported. The provided New York data json file is used as the raw data for examination. It lists the neighborhoods, longitude, latitude, and borough name for each area in New York City and this information will be used to create neighborhood clusters. This data is organized into a pandas dataframe. The first 21 rows are displayed to show several neighborhoods in the first listed borough. The number of boroughs and neighborhoods are confirmed to be 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. A folium map is displayed to visualize the neighborhoods and boroughs. Queens is selected based on business interests for expansion into the multicultural borough of New York City as there is need for more vegetarian and dining options according to Yelp.com reviews. A zoomed in map highlighting the Queens borough of New York area is displayed. The first row of the Neighborhoods column is displayed to confirm and demonstrate that segments of Queens are included in the data. A search query for 'Vegetarian is used' as it is listed as a category as one of the most common venues in Queens, New York. My Foursquare credentials allow access into exploring the neighborhoods in Queens for most common venues. Foursquare data and pandas are used to highlight the categories in Queens, New York. One hundred venues are returned by Foursquare. A dataframe table includes a list of all Queens’ neighborhoods and venue category by number to get a high-level view of the diversity of venues in queens. The top 5 venues are then listed as individual data tables with their corresponding frequency, which demonstrates the rank of the common venues compared to the other listed venues. A new dataframe table organizes the Queens ten most common venues for each Queens' neighborhood. K-means clustering sorts the Queens neighborhoods according to common venue data. This is then used to create a new dataframe table. Folium mapping allows us to visualize the clusters created according to common venues in Queens. Data frame of 5 example clusters for venues in Queens are used to locate common venues of any type restaurant, gym, park, etc. to arrive at the most common vegetarian and vegan restaurants listed as a top 10 venue in Queens’ neighborhoods. If a vegetarian and vegan restaurant is listed it is a prime area for this type of dining and other locations are discovered that do not have a vegetarian and vegan restaurant option as a leading top 10 venue. These would be locations to explore to grow the vegetarian and vegan dining experience."

Ln 14 shows the first 21 rows of boroughs in New York and the neighborhoods with in them listed individually in each row as an example of what is shown in the dataframe. Format, unique, and shape commands are used to determine the number of boroughs and neighborhoods in New York. There are 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods meaning there are numerous areas to consider for building a vegetarian / vegan restaurant.

    "Fresh Meadows and South Jamaica may be neighborhoods with interest in more vegetarian and vegan options since this restaurant type is one of the top 10 venues, demonstrating the potential for growth in local vegetarian and vegan dining. Clusters 2 may be a profitable area to add a vegetarian / vegan restaurant since it has venue categories for vegetarian and vegan already begun in this area and is the only cluster with vegetarian and vegan as a most common venue. Cluster 4, Breezy Point and Newponsit neighborhoods, feautures beaches as the most common venue and may also have interest in a vegetarian and vegan restaurant with landmark, restaurants, event spaces as most common areas. Somerville is the only neighborhood in Cluster 3 and features a nature preserve so a new restaurant may not be the best for this neighborhood. Cluster 5 could also be a good area because it does not have vegetarian and vegan restaurant as a most common venue but has high consumer traffic with area attractions such as tennis courts and playground where residents and travelers may gather and frequent the area and may prefer vegetarian and vegan options. Cluster 5,  with the Malba and Bayswater neighborhoods, has tennis courts and playground as the most (first most) common venue and event spaces as common venues prefer vegetarian and vegan dining options. Clusters 1 and 2 contain numerous restaurant types included and Cluster 2 has the only two vegetarian and vegan restaurant listed as a most common venue within the top 10 common venues. However, both clusters are too large to pinpoint a specific neighborhood based on k-means clustering alone. Additional analysis and characteristics of the neighborhoods dining preferences, especially in Clusters 1 and 2, could be explored to further understand where to build a restaurant. As Queens is a multicultural area, the vegetarian and vegan restaurants may choose to add various dishes based on the most common local restaurant categories including Filipino, Chinese, and Pizza, which are common restaurant categories that may not have many vegetarian and vegan options and this could present good competition for Filipino, Chinese, and Pizza restaurant goers for example.
